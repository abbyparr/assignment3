The purpose of my project is to understand how NumPy works and how to import and load data into python. It is also about using ndarrays and comparing them. With this, the purpose is the analyze the NBA data in relation to NumPy and ndarrays. My program has the input of the file name, "NBA_Player_Stats.tsv." The outputs in my program include: field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, free throw accuracy, average points scored per minute, overall shooting accuracy, the average number of blocks per game, and average number of steals per game. The program is used by comparing ndarrays and determining a value based on the data. The module I used is called NBAstats.
